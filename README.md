# JS Playground

This is a small browser-only logic gate simulator. Open `index.html` in a modern
web browser and drag gates from the sidebar onto the workspace. Connect gate
pins to create wires, toggle switches by double-clicking them and watch lights
update live.

Use the **Save** button to download the circuit as a JSON file and **Load** to
restore a saved design.

Select gates or wires with the mouse and press `Delete` to remove them.
